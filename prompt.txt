To run the code, set a terminal at the directory where Blender is installed (first line), then call the software along with the path to the file 'main.py' (second line) to execute the algorithm.

Example in Windows:

cd C :\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender
blender.exe -b -P E:\ggalli\python\UAVmachine\GIT\main.py

Having any issues running Blender from the terminal? This <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/render/workflows/command_line.html> may help.

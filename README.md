# UASmachine
## A field high-throughput phenotyping simulation tool

This algorithm uses the open source software Blender<sup>TM</sup> (https://www.blender.org) to generate <i>in silico</i> 3D experiments. It is mainly focused on simulating field experiments and capturing UAS-like data.

This research creates the possibility of testing new methods and experimental setups before field testing, which may lead to significant experimentation savings.

The algorithm has been developed under Blender 2.79b API which can be downloaded at 
https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.79/.

This work is part of the original research reported on the manuscript entitled "A novel way to validate UAS-based high-throughput phenotyping protocols using in silico experiments for plant breeding purposes".

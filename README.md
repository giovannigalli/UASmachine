# UASmachine
## First ever field high-throughput phenotyping simulation tool.

This algorithm uses the open source software Blender<sup>TM</sup> (https://www.blender.org) to generate <i>in silico</i> 3D experiments. It is mainly focused on simulating field experiments and capturing UAS-like data.

This research creates the possibility of testing new methods and experimental setups before field testing, which may lead to significant experimentation savings.

The algorithms are part of the original manuscript entitled "" under consideration in ... .
